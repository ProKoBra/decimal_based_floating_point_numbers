The file modIntToFP.hpp contains four classes. One of these is important it's the class "modFP_64".
The constructor takes one parameter which is a string this is the value which you want to put into the variable,
you can insert a point into this string and then the variable will represent a number with a point.
This Datatype implements every normal floating point operation but it doesn't implements operations like logarithms or roots etc.
In my concept, precision is going before useability with this reasons I've implemented errors 
which will say you that something went wrong like a number which doesn't fit in the 64bit or something else.

If you can find any wrong results, then please tell it to me and I'll fix it.
